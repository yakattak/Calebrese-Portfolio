                        You've done it. You've found the end of the internet and this is your prize...HI! My name is Steve and I like to have a lot irons in the fire. 
                        I'm a husband, coach, frisbeer, property manager, teacher, engineer, and (apparently)- developer! 
                        </p>
                        I've earned my B.S. and M.S in Materials Science and Engineering from RPI in Troy, NY, as well as my M.A.T in Education from Union Graduate College in 
                        Schenectady, NY. From 2015-2021 my full-time job was a physics and engineering teacher at Hoosick Falls High School in Hoosick Falls, NY. As much as I love teaching, I recently
                        decided to take my career in a new direction and enrolled in Full-Stack "bootcamp" through Columbia University. Simulataneously, I have accepted a new position as a Lead Materials Engineer with
                        GE Aviation in Lynn, MA.
                        <p>
                        My wife and I are extremely excited for our new adventure and the infinite possibilities my courswork and new career will afford it. Please be sure to check back here frequently for updates!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I hope you enjoy!

                    <p>In 2015 I decided to pursue a career as a high school physics teacher. Although I have chosen a new path, my passion for teaching still remains. As time permits I still like to create video lessons and post them to my youtube channel.  Here is an example of one such video I created while teaching.
